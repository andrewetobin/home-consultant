This [project](https://evening-lowlands-52452.herokuapp.com/) was submitted as the second Module 3 group project at the Turing School of Software and Design. Designed to function as an introduction to interacting with an external API, students are expected to appropriately utilize POST requests, create API services and micro-services, develop adequate MVC architecture, and render the results of their queries using JQuery and JavaScript.

## Introduction and Function

This project was designed to serve as a home consultation tool prototype for TRELORA, a Denver-based real estate brokerage. By partnering with the Turing School of Software and Design, TRELORA has provided a valuable learning experience for Module 3 students, while simultaneously outsourcing creative design potential. 

The [premise](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux) of the project is to build a Bike Share website, that tracked the analytics of a San Francisco bike-for-rent company as well as to serve as a shop for bicycle-related accessories. The site needed to demonstrate full functionality, allowing the user to log in, log out, choose and checkout accessories, and to see relevant information pertaining to the trips, conditions, and stations involved with the bikes.
